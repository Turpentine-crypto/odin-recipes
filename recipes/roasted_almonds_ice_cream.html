        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Almonds</strong>: Whole raw almonds, roasted to perfection for a deep, nutty flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Heavy ice cream </strong>& <strong>whole milk</strong>: The base of the ice cream, providing richness and creaminess.</li>
            <li><strong>Sugar</strong>: Granulated sugar for sweetness and a smooth texture.</li>
            <li><strong>Egg Yolks</strong>: Create a custard base, giving the ice cream a luxurious, creamy consistency.</li>
            <li><strong>Vanilla Extract</strong>: Enhances the flavor of the roasted almonds.</li>
            <li><strong>Salt</strong>: A pinch to balance the sweetness and bring out the nuttiness of the almonds.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Roast the Almonds</strong>: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Spread the raw almonds in a single layer on a baking sheet. Roast for 8-10 minutes until they’re fragrant and lightly browned, then let them cool. Once cooled, roughly chop the almonds and set aside.</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Custard Base</strong>: In a medium saucepan, combine the heavy cream, milk, and half of the sugar. Heat the mixture over medium heat until it’s just about to boil, then remove it from the heat.</li>
            <li><strong>Whisk the egg yolks</strong>: In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and the remaining sugar until the mixture is pale and slightly thickened. Slowly temper the hot cream mixture into the egg yolks, whisking constantly to avoid curdling.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook the custard</strong>: Return the mixture to the saucepan and cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until the custard thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon. Be careful not to let it boil.</li>
            <li><strong>Flavour with Vanilla & Almonds</strong>: Remove the custard from the heat and stir in the vanilla extract. Allow the custard to cool slightly, then fold in the roasted almonds.</li>
            <li><strong>Chill & Churn</strong>: Transfer the custard to a bowl, cover, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight. Once chilled, churn the mixture in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</li>
            <li><strong>Freeze & Serve</strong>: After churning, transfer the ice cream to a freezer-safe container and freeze for at least 4 hours, or until firm. Serve the roasted almond ice cream in bowls or cones, and enjoy the perfect balance of creamy and crunchy in every bite.</li>
