        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Potatoes</strong>: Russet potatoes work best for that perfect balance of crispiness and fluffiness.</li>
            <li><strong>Seasoned Flour</strong>: A mix of all-purpose flour and cornstarch for the coating.</li>
            <li><strong>Seasoning Blend</strong>: Paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper, black pepper, and salt.</li>
            <li><strong>Buttermilk</strong>: Adds a subtle tang and helps the seasoning adhere to the fries.</li>
            <li><strong>Oil for Frying</strong>: Vegetable or peanut oil for that signature crisp.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Cut the Potatoes</strong>: Slice the russet potatoes into thick, even strips. For best results, aim for a thickness similar to Popeyes’ fries. Rinse the potatoes in cold water to remove excess starch, then pat them dry with paper towels.</li>
            <li><strong>Season the Flour</strong>: In a large bowl, combine the flour, cornstarch, and a generous amount of seasoning (paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne, salt, and pepper). This seasoned coating is key to getting that perfect crispy crust.</li>
            <li><strong>Soak the Fries</strong>: Dunk the potato strips into buttermilk to add moisture and flavor, then dredge them in the seasoned flour mixture, making sure each fry is well coated.</li>
            <li><strong>Fry the Potatoes</strong>: Heat oil in a large pot or deep fryer to 350°F (175°C). Fry the potatoes in batches, making sure not to overcrowd the pan. Cook until golden brown and crispy, about 5-7 minutes per batch. Remove the fries with a slotted spoon and drain them on paper towels.</li>
            <li><strong>Season and Serve</strong>: While the fries are still hot, sprinkle them with an additional pinch of the seasoning blend. Serve immediately for that irresistible crunch.</li>
        </ol>
